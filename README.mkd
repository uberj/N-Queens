N Queens
========

Right now it just prints the solutions out. Eventually it will save board states and account for rotations and reflections.

usage:

    python nqueens.py <number of queens>

Example:

    python nqueens.py 4

_Note: I was completely sober (seriously, @mythmon can confirm) while writing this code._
